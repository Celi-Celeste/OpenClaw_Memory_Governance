# OpenClaw Memory Governance

This project provides a production-friendly memory governance layer for OpenClaw with a strict split:

1. Config-only runtime tuning
2. Skill-only cadence and drift logic

It is designed for teams that want long-horizon memory improvements without forking OpenClaw core.
